        <h1>Process</h1>
        <p>
          I started with the products page because I figured that was going to
          be the easiest. I then moved to do the cart page then the remaining
          pages.

      <div className="struggles">
        <h1>Struggles</h1>
        <p>
          I don't understand Javascript or React very well so this whole
          capstone was difficult.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="favorite">
        <h1>Favorite language</h1>
        <p>
          Im not sure if I have a favorite language as of yet. I have enjoyed
          everything I have, even with the struggles, in the two classes Ive
          done.
